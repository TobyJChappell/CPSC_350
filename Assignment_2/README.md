This program simulates Conway's "Game of Life" according to the specifications of assign2_Life.pdf. In summary of this document, the user is prompted if they want to generate a random board or input from a file. There are 3 boundary options the user can choose from: Classic, Doughnut, and Mirror. The program then prompts the user to decide if they want their output to have a brief pause between generations, for it to require them to hit "enter," or for their output to be sent to a text file. All files with the extension ".txt" are sample input files to test on the program.
