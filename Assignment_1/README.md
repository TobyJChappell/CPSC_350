The program first takes in a file containing a list of nucleotides (consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'T', and 'G'). It then analyzes the input file and computes the sum, mean, variance, standard deviation, probability of each nucleotide, and probability of each pair. Next, the stats are outputted to a file called "tobychappell.out." Finally, 1000 DNA strings are appended to the output file. The length of each string is determined by Gaussian distribution and the probability of each nucleotide is based on the statistics previously calculated. The program can be repeated as many times as the user wishes in which the results are appended to the output file.
