This program is a database containing students and faculty members using a binary search tree. When the user runs the program, 2 trees are retrieved from 2 files called "studentTable" and "facultyTable." The user is then prompted with 16 options to choose from. Once finished, the user can enter "16" to exit the program which will serialize the newly updated trees into binary files.  

In addition to the specifications in the pdf, the user can also edit information about a student or faculty member after it has been inputted into the table. Furthermore, if the user enters an invalid id (either student, faculty member, or advisee), the existing ids are then displayed to the user.

Binary files that are created should not be edited. If they are, simply remove both tables and the program will start up again with blank data tables.
